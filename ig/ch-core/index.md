### Introduction
This implementation guide is provided to support the use of FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> in a Swiss context.

This document is a working specification that is expected to be implemented and tested by FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> system producers to enable feedback to improve the content of this guide.

### Scope

This document presents Swiss use concepts defined via FHIR processable artefacts; these are collaborative outputs with agreed approaches to varied kinds of healthcare related information based on the core FHIR R4 specification. 
* [Profiles](profiles.html) - are useful constraints of core FHIR resources and datatype for Swiss use
* [Extensions](extensions.html) - are FHIR extensions that are added for local use, covering needed Swiss concepts
* [Terminologies](terminology.html) - are defined or referenced code systems and value sets for Swiss context

FHIR profiles are managed under HL7 Switzerland:

* [HL7 Switzerland Technical Comitee](https://www.hl7.ch/technisches-komitee/)

### Collaboration
This guide is the product of collaborative work undertaken with participants from:

* [Swiss FHIR Implementers Community](https://www.fhir.ch)
* [HL7 Switzerland](https://www.hl7.ch)
* [eHealth Suisse](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/startseite.html)
