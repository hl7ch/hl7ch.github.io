    <p>This Implementation Guide uses FHIR defined resources – Composition Resource, Questionnaire Resource,
    QuestionnaireResponse Resource, Patient Resource, PractitionerRole Resource, Practitioner Resource, Organization Resource, ServiceRequest Resource and Bundle Resource from
    FHIR R4. For details on HL7 FHIR R4 see <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/r4">http://hl7.org/fhir/r4</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The Order &amp; Referral by Form (ORF) Implementation Guide describes how forms for eReferrals, requests for
        information (such as diagnostic imaging results, lab results, discharge reports etc.) can be defined, deployed and
        used in order to achieve a syntactical and semantically consistent cross enterprise information exchange.
    </p>
    <p>The Implementation Guide supports creation and domain wide deployment of forms for structured and coded information
        exchange as well as exchange of such forms for referral, orders etc. The Implementation Guide relies on FHIR e.g.
        the questionnaire resource. Because the Implementation Guide relies heavily on the FHIR Resources Questionnaire and
        QuestionnaireResponse, forms are addressed here as Questionnaires.
    </p>
    <p>This Implementation Guide is derived from the HL7 Structured Data Capture Implementation Guide, see 
        <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/2019May/">SDC IG (v2.7.0)</a> and uses the Swiss Core Profiles, see

    <a name="volume1"> </a><h3>Volume 1 – Order &amp; Referral by Form (CH ORF) Implementation Guide</h3>
    <p>This Implementation Guide concerns directional information exchange between institutions such as requests for
        referral, requests for previous imaging results, requests for second opinions etc. as well as corresponding
        responses. Such request are often done – or could be done – by means of structured forms. The same may apply for
        responses or documents coming along in case the response consists of a particular payload (e.g. exam results).
        However, forms for these purposes are in general proprietary constructs and seldom suitable for further machine
        processing. Furthermore, such forms are more or less hard coded and concerned systems may not easily be updated for
        new use cases.
    </p>

    <p>The ORF Implementation Guide addresses two issues:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>It supports a scenario where an authority (e.g. health authority, expert panel etc.) defines a set of forms
        (here called Questionnaires) for well-defined use cases which then are deployed in a specific enterprise, domain
        etc. or even nationwide.</li>
        <li>New use cases or changes in use cases can easily be handled either by modification of existing Questionnaires or
        new ones. The Implementation Guide itself is agnostic to the nature of a particular Questionnaire and the ORF
        Implementation Guide puts only little limits on its definition.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Vendors implementing the ORF Implementation Guide benefit of a high re-use potential. Applications which support the
    ORF Implementation Guide may be used for various settings of directional information exchange. The specific needs of
    a particular use case will be covered by a adequate design of the Questionnaire and the value sets being used.
    </p>
    <p>When writing the ORF Implementation Guide, the authors had the following use case in mind: A human fills in a
    Questionnaire for a particular request and sends this Questionnaire to a receiver. There, a human reads the
    Questionnaire with its content. A corresponding response will work in the same way. There is possibly some payload
    coming with the Questionnaire: A request may be accompanied by results of preceding exams (e.g. images, reports);
    the response may be a diagnostic result.
    </p>
    <p>The primary aim of the ORF Implementation Guide is to assure a consistent representation of Questionnaires at both –
    filler- and receiver – site. But there is the need for further machine processing: at filler site in terms of
    prepopulating attributes with content from other applications (e.g. demographic data of a patient) whereas the
    receiver may want to have the content of the form ready for further processing in his applications. Obviously the
    two aims – semantic interoperability and flexibility in the definition of Questionnaires – are contradictory. The
    ORF Implementation Guide addresses this problem by a mandatory set of generic elements and codes with
    defined meaning which are part of every Questionnaire in the ORF Implementation Guide. It is up to a SDC Form
    Designer to create Questionnaires with additional use case specific elements.
    </p>
    <p>There has been a discussion whether population of the resources such as Patient Resource, ServiceRequest Resource 
    etc. with the content of the QuestionnaireResponse Resource should be done by the order placer application or rather 
    by the order filler application. The argument for assigning the task to the order placer is a result of the following 
    consideration: the authors of a particular implementation guide  may decide to define a questionnaire and its rendering 
    but to leave it open if in a particular implementation the questionnaire is implemented or if the representation towards 
    the user is made (in accordance to the questionnaire definition) by other technical means. In such a case, there would 
    be no QuestionnaireResponse Resource in the bundle because all content is already in concerning resources. In order to 
    handle all FHIR exchange formats equal (as far as sensible), the authors decided to mandate the order placer application 
    with the task.
    </p>
    <p>Applications claiming for conformance with the ORF Implementation Guide shall:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Render (and in case of the Questionnaire filler allow for data entry) all elements of a questionnaire in the
        user interface (e.g. on screen, in print). Grouping of items and the order of items within shall be adequately
        reproduced according to the Questionnaire.</li>

        <li>In case of an implementation without Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse, the content of otherwise implemented UIs shall 
        be in accordance to the questionnaire definition.</li>
        
        <li>Be able to process all codes related to the generic elements in a Questionnaire.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vendors of applications with Questionnaire Filler/Questionnaire Receiver Actors are strongly recommended to implement
    interfaces to other applications (such as HIS and PACS) for all data in the generics elements of
    Questionnaires.
    </p>
    <p>Applications designed like this will provide out-of-the-box interconnectivity for generic elements as well as
    out-of-the-box interoperability for all questionnaires as far it concerns user interfaces at filler and receiver
    site.
    </p>
    <p>Nothing speaks against interfaces for data in the use case specific part of a particular Questionnaire. One has
    however to keep in mind, that such interfaces are tied to a specific questionnaire. Ownership or other means, which
    prevent changes of the questionnaire by third parties, are therefore advisable.
    </p>
    <p>The ORF Implementation Guide deals with Transport, Workflow and Content. It is based on FHIR resources and in
    particular the FHIR Questionnaire resource. FHIR specifies RESTful Web services as a mean for transport.  An
    implementation based on RESTful Web services is strongly recommended however not mandatory to comply with the ORF
    Implementation Guide. Workflow is addressed by the scope of ORF Implementation Guide which addresses directional
    information exchange with request and response. Content is defined by a set of generic given elements
    and codes and the possibility to extend both as required by the use cases addressed.
    </p>

    <p>This Implementation Guide depends on the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/history.cfml">SDC Implementation Guide</a>:
    </p>
    <p>Questionnaires and forms permeate healthcare. They are used to capture administrative data, claims data, clinical
    information, research information, for public health reporting - every type of data that is manipulated by
    healthcare systems. They provide a user-friendly mechanism for capturing data in a consistent way. In FHIR, forms
    are represented using the Questionnaire resource and completed forms are represented using the QuestionnaireResponse
    resource. The base FHIR specification defines these resources but doesn't provide much guidance around how they
    should be used, nor does it set minimal expectations for interoperation. The <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/2019May/">SDC Implementation Guide</a> 
    provides a set of guidance around the use of Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse.

    <a name="volume1"> </a><h6>Questionnaire Usage Process Flow</h6>
    <p>Dr. Miller has a new Patient John Doe who has had an MRI at the radiology service “S-U-P-E-R-XR”. Dr. Miller
        retrieves a special order questionnaire from the SDC Form Manager at S-U-P-E-R-XR which allows ordering of
        images and reports of previous exams. Dr. Miller fills in this questionnaire and sends it back. At S-U-P-E-R-XR, a
        staff member will fill in another Questionnaire with a reply, attaches images and reports an sends all to Dr. Miller.
    </p>

    <a name="volume1"> </a><h4>ORF Security Considerations</h4>
    <p>A resource server should not return any patient information unless proper authentication and communications
        security have been proven.
    </p>
    <p>There are many reasonable methods of securing interoperability transactions. These security models can be layered
        in without modifying the characteristics of the ORF Profile transactions. The use of TLS is mandatory.
    </p>
    <p>User authentication on mobile devices is encouraged using Internet User Authorization (IUA) Profile. The network
        communication security and user authentication are layered in at the HTTP transport layer and do not modify the
        interoperability characteristics defined in the ORF Profile.
    </p>
    <p>The Security Audit logging (e.g. ATNA) is recommended. Support for ATNA-based audit logging on the mobile health
        device may be beyond the ability of this constrained environment.
    </p>
    <p>In case vendors decide to include the Patient ID (patient.identifier) as a query parameter on the Resource URL
        (what would be out of the scope of ORF Implementation Guide), this URL pattern would present a risk when using typical
        web server audit logging of URL requests, and browser history. In both of these cases the URL with the patient
        identity would be clearly visible. These risks should be mitigated in system or operational design.

    <a name="volume3"> </a><h3>Volume 3 – Content Modules</h3>

    <a name="volume3"> </a><h4>Questionnaire Content</h4>
    <p>This section describes the content of a form. The following definitions apply:
    </p>
    <p>Request and responses consist of filled in questionnaires. Some elements of the questionnaire are generic given
        elements (such as author, data entry person, receiver etc.) and are always present in a questionnaire compliant to
        the ORF Implementation Guide. In addition, a questionnaire will contain elements which are use case specific. The
        ORF Implementation Guide makes no assumptions about the nature of such elements: structure and content (including
        coding of codes elements) are in the responsibility of those creating a form for a particular use case.
    </p>
    <p>As this Implementation Guide is based on FHIR, the following rules apply:
    </p>
    <p>Items, grouping of items, order of groups and order of elements within groups of a questionnaire shall be defined
        in a Questionnaire Resource. The Questionnaire Resource is defined by means of the SDC From Designer and made
        available by the SDC Form Manager.
    </p>
    <p>Based on the Questionnaire, a Questionnaire Filler defines a QuestionnaireResponse and appropriate additional
        resources aimed at transmitting the information provided by the Questionnaire filler in a standardized
        structured form. Upon completion of the questionnaire, the Questionnaire Filler shall create a bundle with all resources
        mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p>Questionnaires may be accompanied by additional material which can be attached or sent by postal mail (e.g.
        xray-films or paper documents). The use case may require some references between attached objects (e.g. which
        pdf-reports belongs to which imaging study).
    </p>


    <a name="volume3"> </a><h4>Generic elements of a questionnaire</h4>
    <p>A questionnaire shall have a set of generic elements (e.g. author, data entry person, receiver etc.).

    <a name="volume3"> </a><h4>FHIR Representation</h4>
    <p>FHIR depicts forms (questionnaires) in a Questionnaire Resource. A Questionnaire Resource can be conceived as an
        empty questionnaire where as the filled in questionnaire refers to the QuestionnaireResponse Resource.
        QuestionnaireResponse Resources are certainly structured but due to their flexibility in design not in a
        standardized manner. FHIR addresses this issue by means of its standardized resources.
    </p>
    <p>The Order &amp; Referral by Form Implementation Guide is based on two FHIR Resources profiles. For details on
        profiling FHIR see HL7 FHIR <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html</a>. For details on
        FHIR resources and data-types see HL7 FHIR <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/">http://hl7.org/fhir/</a>.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Order &amp; Referral by Form Questionnaire (ORF) Implementation Guide defines the usage of the FHIR
            Questionnaire Resource within the Order &amp; Referral by Form. The Questionnaire Resource is an organized
            collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals
            involved in the healthcare domain. They may be simple flat lists of questions or can be hierarchically organized in
            groups and sub-groups, each containing questions. The Questionnaire defines the questions to be asked, how
            they are ordered and grouped and what the constraints are on the allowed answers. The results of a Questionnaire
            can be communicated using the QuestionnaireResponse resource (see 
            <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html">http://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html</a>).</li>
        <li>The Order &amp; Referral by Form Document (ORF) Profile defines the usage of the FHIR Bundle within the
            Order &amp; Referral by Form (ORF) Implementation Guide. The ORFDocumentProfile consist of a FHIR document
            (bundle) that contains the results of a filled in Questionnaire (QuestionnaireResponse Resource) together with the
            structured resources which map all information filled in the questionnaire. The 
            <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html">Bundle</a> is of 
            <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/bundle-definitions.html#Bundle.type">type</a> "document" and has a 
            <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/composition.html">Composition</a> resource as the first resource in the
            bundle, followed by a series of other resources, referenced from the Composition resource. The bundle gathers all
            the content of the document into a single document which may be signed and managed as required. The
            resources include both human readable and computer processable sections. In addition, a bundle as defined in this
            profile shall include a CSS stylesheets and optionally it may include a signature.<br/><br/>Any resource
            referenced directly in the Composition Resource shall be included in the bundle. Other resources that these referenced
            resources refer to shall also be included in the bundle. Including these additional resources will make the
            document bigger, but will save applications from needing to retrieve the linked resources.</li>

    <p>
        In the Composition, general information about the document is defined, such as title, type and category. 
        In the CH ORF exchange format, no fixed values are determined for these elements, only a preferred binding to specific ValueSets is made. 
        These values are context-dependent and have to be specified in the corresponding derived exchange format.
        They must be defined as fixedValues or limited ValueSet in the Composition profile.

    <a name="volume3"> </a><h6>Questionnaire resource</h6>
    <p>The intention of the ORF Implementation Guide is to provide a standardized representation of forms at sender and
    receiver site as well. This is achieved with the Questionnaire Resource, which defines representation of all
    elements for the user (with the help of a CSS) and user interaction as well (e.g. with drop down lists).
    </p>
    <p>This approach requires two things:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Precise definition of all questions</li>
        <li>Mapping between elements of the Questionnaire Resource and the corresponding elements of the other resources
            in the bundle</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Both is achieved by assigning meaningful concepts to all elements concerned. For codes refer to Appendix A.
