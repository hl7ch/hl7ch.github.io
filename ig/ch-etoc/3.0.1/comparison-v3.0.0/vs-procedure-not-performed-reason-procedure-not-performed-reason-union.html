<h2>Union of http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/procedure-not-performed-reason and http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/procedure-not-performed-reason</h2>

<p>
  This is the ValueSet that contains all the codes in Procedure Not Performed Reason (SNOMED-CT) (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/procedure-not-performed-reason) and Procedure Not Performed Reason (SNOMED-CT) (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/procedure-not-performed-reason). E.g. what you have to deal with if you get resources containing codes in either of them
