## Dosage

### Overview

This implementation guide currently describes the **normal dosing** and the **split dosing**. The normal dosing can be given in a structured form and/or as narrative text. If possible, the structured form SHOULD be provided. In case structured dosage instructions are not provided or for complex dosages, the dosage can be represented using narrative text.

In the structured form, the format 1-1-1-1, meaning the administration time in the morning, at noon, in the evening, at night, is supported. For [normal dosing](#normal-dosing), the dose quantity is the same at the defined administration times (e.g. 1-0-0-0, 1-0-1-0). For [split dosing](#split-dosing), the dose quantity varies depending on the administration time (e.g. 1-0-2-0, 2-1-2-0).

The dosage instruction is based on the **6.3.4.6 Dosage Instructions Content Module (1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.9.1.3.6)** in the [IHE Pharmacy Technical Framework Supplement: Community Prescription (PRE)](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Pharmacy/IHE_Pharmacy_Suppl_PRE.pdf).

#### Timing

##### Start and Stop

The (outer) bounds of the treatment period are mapped as start and/or end dates (with or without time).

##### Timing Event

For the representation of the time of administration according to the 1-1-1-1 scheme, the values MORN-NOON-EVE-NIGHT from the [ValueSet EventTiming](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/valueset-event-timing.html) SHOULD be used for the Swiss use.

#### Dose and Rate

The amount of medication administered according to the 1-1-1-1 scheme SHALL be represented with SNOMED CT or UCUM codes, which are defined in the [ValueSet UnitCode](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/ValueSet-UnitCode.html).

#### In Reserve

Implementations MAY indicate whether the medication is taken only as needed (e.g., when pain occurs) as part of the specified dosing schedule. If it is a reserve medication, the dosage indicated is the maximum dosage the patient may take.

#### Route of Administration

A code for specifying the route of administration into or onto a patient's body SHALL be taken from the [ValueSet EDQM - RouteOfAdministration](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-term/ValueSet-edqm-routeofadministration.html).

#### Patient Instruction

Instructions to the patient regarding the administration of the medication, e.g. taking with food. The instructions are in a patient understandable language. 
 Additionally, if no structured dosage instructions are provided or the dosage is complex, the dosage can be represented here using narrative text.

 The current FHIR representation of the dosage within the defined documents for the exchange of medication information is shown here. The use case and the corresponding examples contain the so-called normal and split dosing. 

 The implementers are asked here to communicate other dosage forms that are relevant in their environment, so that any expansions can be made in a next step. Or feedback on whether these dosage forms are sufficient would be helpful. 

 Please add your feedback via the 'Propose a change'-link in the footer of the page. 

 

### Normal Dosing

The normal dosing is represented using **one dosage element**. The dosage can be in a [structured form](#normal-dosing---structured), [narrative text](#normal-dosing---narrative), or a [combination of both](#normal-dosing---structured--narrative).

#### Normal Dosing - Structured

Dosing example based on the use case step 2-5:

| | | | | | | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | tablet | as needed | oral | 04.02.2012 - | Take with food |

```
  "dosage" : [
    {
      "patientInstruction" : "Take with food",
      "timing" : {
        "repeat" : {
          "boundsPeriod" : {
              "start" : "2012-02-04"
          },
          "when" : [
            "MORN",
            "EVE"
          ]
        }
      },
      "asNeededBoolean" : true,
      "route" : {
        "coding" : [
          {
            "system" : "urn:oid:0.4.0.127.0.16.1.1.2.1",
            "code" : "20053000",
            "display" : "Oral use"
          }
        ]
      },
      "doseAndRate" : [
        {
          "doseQuantity" : {
            "value" : 1,
            "unit" : "Tablet (unit of presentation)",
            "system" : "http://snomed.info/sct",
            "code" : "732936001"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

```

#### Normal Dosing - Narrative

The narrative dosage instructions is represented in the `Dosage.patientInstruction` element.

Dosing example where no structured form is provided:

| | | | | | | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | Take 2 tablets daily as usual before dinner with a little water, reduce the dosage one week before surgery to 1 tablet daily. |

```
  "dosage" : [
    {
      "patientInstruction" : "Take 2 tablets daily as usual before dinner with a little water, reduce the dosage one week before surgery to 1 tablet daily.",
    }
  ]

```

#### Normal Dosing - Structured & Narrative

Dosing example with the structured form and supplemented by the narrative text:

| | | | | | | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|   |   |   |   |   |   | oral | 01.09.2022 - 14.09.2022 | Take one tablet in the morning and one in the evening on even days. On odd days, take half a tablet in the morning and half in the evening. |

```
  "dosage" : [
    {
      "patientInstruction" : "Take one tablet in the morning and one in the evening on even days. On odd days, take half a tablet in the morning and half in the evening.",
      "timing" : {
        "repeat" : {
          "boundsPeriod" : {
            "start" : "2022-09-01",
            "end" : "2022-09-14"
          },
          "when" : [
            "MORN",
            "EVE"
          ]
        }
      },
      "route" : {
        "coding" : [
          {
            "system" : "urn:oid:0.4.0.127.0.16.1.1.2.1",
            "code" : "20053000",
            "display" : "Oral use"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]

```

### Split Dosing

The split dosing differs from the normal dosing in that the dosage element is repeated. In contrast to normal dosing, where the dosage element occurs once, the **dosage element** can be repeated **n times** in split dosing. The order of the dosage instructions SHALL be defined by the required element `Dosage.sequence`. 
 The information, which is the same for all dosage elements (`patientInstruction`, `timing.repeat.boundsPeriod`, `asNeeded`, `route`) MUST be mapped in the first dosage element.

Dosing example based on the use case step 2-3:

| | | | | | | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 0 | 0.5 | 0 | tablet |   | oral | 04.02.2012 - | Take with food |

```
  "dosage" : [
    {
      "sequence" : 1,
      "patientInstruction" : "Take with food",
      "timing" : {
        "repeat" : {
          "boundsPeriod" : {
            "start" : "2012-02-04"
          },
          "when" : [
            "MORN"
          ]
        }
      },
      "route" : {
        "coding" : [
          {
            "system" : "urn:oid:0.4.0.127.0.16.1.1.2.1",
            "code" : "20053000",
            "display" : "Oral use"
          }
        ]
      },
      "doseAndRate" : [
        {
          "doseQuantity" : {
            "value" : 1,
