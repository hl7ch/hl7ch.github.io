## Aggregator

### Aggregator

#### Aggregation without problems

There are different Immunization Administration documents with different entries.

Examples in [Test Case TC A 01](TC_A01.md), [Test Case TC A 02](TC_A02.md), [Test Case TC A 03](TC_A03.md), [Test Case TC B 01](TC_B01.md), [Test Case TC B 02](TC_B02.md), [Test Case TC B 03](TC_B03.md), [Test Case TC B 04](TC_B04.md), [Test Case TC B 05](TC_B05.md)

#### Aggregation with duplicated entries - error

There are different Immunization Administration documents with different entries, but in two documents the same entry is documented.

Examples in [Test Case TC D 01](TC_D01.md), [Test Case TC D 02](TC_D02.md), [Test Case TC D 03](TC_D03.md)

#### Aggregation with referencing documentation

There are different Immunization Administration documents with different entries, but in one document i.e. replaces an entry of an other document by reference.

Examples int [Test Case TC A 04](TC_A04.md), [Test Case TC C 01](TC_C01.md), [Test Case TC C 02](TC_C02.md), [Test Case TC C 03](TC_C03.md), [Test Case TC C 04](TC_C04.md), [Test Case TC C 05](TC_C05.md)
