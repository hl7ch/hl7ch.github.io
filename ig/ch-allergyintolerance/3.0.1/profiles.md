## Profiles

* [CH AllergyIntolerance](StructureDefinition-ch-allergyintolerance.md) 
This profile represents the constraints applied to the AllergyIntolerance resource in the Swiss context (based on CH IPS). A record of an allergy or intolerance is represented in the Swiss EPR, in a TransitionOfCare transaction or similar as an instance of an AllergyIntolerance resource constrained by this profile. It documents the relevant allergies or intolerances for a patient, describing the kind of reaction (e.g. rash, anaphylaxis,..); preferably the agents that cause it; and optionally the criticality and the certainty of the allergy.

* [CH AllergyIntolerance Condition](StructureDefinition-ch-allergyintolerance-condition.md) 
This profile represents the constraints applied to the Condition resource in the context of AllergyIntolerance as a problem-list item or a encounter-diagnosis entry in the Swiss realm - in adaption of the respective usecases provided in the Implementation Guide for Use of SNOMED CT in Documentation of Allergy, Non-allergic Hypersensitivity and Intolerance.
